Many packages have command line entry points. Examples of this type of application are
`mypy <https://github.com/python/mypy>`_,
`flake8 <https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8>`_,
`pipenv <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv>`_,and
`black <https://github.com/ambv/black>`_.

Usually you want to be able to access these from anywhere,
but installing packages and their dependencies to the same global environment
can cause version conflicts and break dependencies the operating system has

`pipx <https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx>`_ solves this by creating a virtual
environment for each package, while also ensuring that package's applications
are accessible through a directory that is on your ``$PATH``. This allows each
package to be upgraded or uninstalled without causing conflicts with other
packages, and allows you to safely run the program from anywhere.
