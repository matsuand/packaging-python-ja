This tutorial walks you through how to package a simple Python project. It will
show you how to add the necessary files and structure to create the package, how
to build the package, and how to upload it to the Python Package Index.
@y
本チュートリアルでは、単純な Python プロジェクトをパッケージングする方法について説明します。
この中では、パッケージの生成に必要となるファイルや構成を作り出した上で、パッケージのビルド方法、また Python パッケージインデックスへのアップロード方法について示します。

A simple project

単純なプロジェクト
------------------
@z

@x
This tutorial uses a simple project named ``example_pkg``. If you are unfamiliar
with Python's modules and :term:`import packages <Import Package>`, take a few
minutes to read over the `Python documentation for packages and modules`_. Even if you already have a project that you want to package up, we recommend following this tutorial as-is using this example package and then trying with your own package.

@x
To create this project locally, create the following file structure:
@y
ローカル環境においてこのプロジェクトを生成するには、以下のファイル構造を作ります。
@z

@x
.. code-block:: text

    packaging_tutorial
    └── example_pkg
        └── __init__.py
@y
.. code-block:: text

    packaging_tutorial
    └── example_pkg
        └── __init__.py
@z

@x
Once you create this structure, you'll want to run all of the commands in this
tutorial within the top-level folder - so be sure to ``cd packaging_tutorial``.
@y
このファイル構造を作ったら、トップフォルダーにおいて本チュートリアルのあらゆるコマンドを実行したくなります。
その際には ``cd packaging_tutorial`` を行うことを忘れないでください。
@z

@x
:file:`example_pkg/__init__.py` is required to import the directory as a package,
and can simply be an empty file.
@y
:file:`example_pkg/__init__.py` はこのディレクトリをパッケージとしてインポートするために必要となります。
単純に空のファイルとするのでもかまいません。

You will now create a handful of files to package up this project and prepare it
for distribution. Create the new files listed below and place them in the project's root directory
- you will add content to them in the following steps.
@y
このプロジェクトをパッケージ化して配布可能とするために、いくつかファイルを作っていきます。
以下に示すファイルを新たに生成して、このプロジェクトのルートディレクトリに置いてください。
各ファイルの内容については、以下に示す手順を通じて定めていきます。

Creating setup.py
-----------------

setup.py の生成
---------------
@z

@x
:file:`setup.py` is the build script for :ref:`setuptools`. It tells setuptools
about your package (such as the name and version) as well as which code files
to include.
@y
:file:`setup.py` は :ref:`setuptools` 用のビルドスクリプトです。
これは setuptools に対してアプリケーションの内容（アプリケーション名やb-ジョンなど）を指示するものであり、ソースコードファイルがどこにあるのかも指示します。
@z

@x
Open :file:`setup.py` and enter the following content. Update the package name to include your username (for example, ``example-pkg-theacodes``), this ensures that you have a unique package name and that your package doesn't conflict with packages uploaded by other people following this tutorial.
@y
:file:`setup.py` を開いて、以下に示す内容を記述します。
パッケージ名のところには自身のユーザー名を記述します（たとえば ``example-pkg-theacodes`` など）。
これはパッケージ名を固有なものにするためであり、本チュートリアルに従って他の人がパッケージをアップロードしても、パッケージ名が衝突しないようにするためです。

:func:`setup` takes several arguments. This example package uses a relatively
minimal set:
@y
:func:`setup` には引数がいくつかあります。
このパッケージ例で利用する引数は、最小限のものとします。
@z

@x
- ``name`` is the *distribution name* of your package. This can be any name as long as only
  contains letters, numbers, ``_`` , and ``-``. It also must not already be
  taken on pypi.org. **Be sure to update this with your username,** as this ensures you won't try to upload a package with the same name as one which already exists when you upload the package.
- ``version`` is the package version see :pep:`440` for more details on
  versions.
- ``author`` and ``author_email`` are used to identify the author of the
  package.
- ``description`` is a short, one-sentence summary of the package.
- ``long_description`` is a detailed description of the package. This is
  shown on the package detail package on the Python Package Index. In
  this case, the long description is loaded from :file:`README.md` which is
  a common pattern.
- ``long_description_content_type`` tells the index what type of markup is
  used for the long description. In this case, it's Markdown.
- ``url`` is the URL for the homepage of the project. For many projects, this
  will just be a link to GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or similar code hosting
  service.
- ``packages`` is a list of all Python :term:`import packages <Import
  Package>` that should be included in the :term:`Distribution Package`.
  Instead of listing each package manually, we can use :func:`find_packages`
  to automatically discover all packages and subpackages. In this case, the
  list of packages will be ``example_pkg`` as that's the only package present.
- ``classifiers`` gives the index and :ref:`pip` some additional metadata
  about your package. In this case, the package is only compatible with Python
  3, is licensed under the MIT license, and is OS-independent. You should
  always include at least which version(s) of Python your package works on,
  which license your package is available under, and which operating systems
  your package will work on. For a complete list of classifiers, see
  https://pypi.org/classifiers/.
@y
- ``name`` はパッケージの **配布名** です。
  英字、数字、``_``、``-`` を利用して任意の名称を定めます。
  ただしその名前は pypi.org において利用されていないものに限ります。
  **アップデートの際には自身のユーザー名を含めるようにしてください**。
  このようにするのは、パッケージをアップロードする際に同一名のパッケージが存在しているかもしれないため、固有名のパッケージアップロードとするためです。
- ``version`` はパッケージバージョンです。
  バージョンに関する詳細は :pep:`440` を参照してください。
- ``author`` と ``author_email`` はパッケージ作者を特定するために利用します。
- ``description`` はパッケージを説明する手短な一文を記述します。
- ``long_description`` is a detailed description of the package. This is
  shown on the package detail package on the Python Package Index. In
  this case, the long description is loaded from :file:`README.md` which is
  a common pattern.
- ``long_description_content_type`` tells the index what type of markup is

It's important for every package uploaded to the Python Package Index to include
a license. This tells users who install your package the terms under which they
can use your package. For help picking a license, see
https://choosealicense.com/. Once you have chosen a license, open
:file:`LICENSE` and enter the license text. For example, if you had chosen the
MIT license:

The ``tar.gz`` file is a :term:`Source Archive` whereas the ``.whl`` file is a
:term:`Built Distribution`. Newer :ref:`pip` versions preferentially install
built distributions, but will fall back to source archives if needed. You
should always upload a source archive and provide built archives for the
platforms your project is compatible with. In this case, our example package is
compatible with Python on any platform so only one built distribution is needed.

The first thing you'll need to do is register an account on ``Test PyPI``. Test
PyPI is a separate instance of the package index intended for testing and
experimentation. It's great for things like this tutorial where we don't
necessarily want to upload to the real index. To register an account, go to
https://test.pypi.org/account/register/ and complete the steps on that page.
You will also need to verify your email address before you're able to upload
any packages.  For more details on Test PyPI, see

.. note:: This example uses ``--index-url`` flag to specify TestPyPI instead of live PyPI. Additionally, it specifies ``--no-deps``. Since TestPyPI doesn't have the same packages as the live PyPI, it's possible that attempting to install dependencies may fail or install something unexpected. While our example package doesn't have any dependencies, it's a good practice to avoid installing dependencies when using TestPyPI.
@y
.. note:: This example uses ``--index-url`` flag to specify TestPyPI instead of live PyPI. Additionally, it specifies ``--no-deps``. Since TestPyPI doesn't have the same packages as the live PyPI, it's possible that attempting to install dependencies may fail or install something unexpected. While our example package doesn't have any dependencies, it's a good practice to avoid installing dependencies when using TestPyPI.

Keep in mind that this tutorial showed you how to upload your package to Test
PyPI, which isn't a permanent storage. The Test system occasionally deletes
packages and accounts. It is best to use Test PyPI for testing and experiments like this tutorial.

do much the same as you did in this tutorial, but with these important

* Choose a memorable and unique name for your package. You don't have to append
  your username as you did in the tutorial.
* Register an account on https://pypi.org - note that these are two separate
  servers and the login details from the test server are not shared with the
  main server.
* Use ``twine upload dist/*`` to upload your package and enter your credentials
  for the account you registered on the real PyPI.  Now that you're uploading
  the package in production, you don't need to specify ``--repository``; the
  package will upload to https://pypi.org/ by default.
* Install your package from the real PyPI using ``pip install [your-package]``.
